# cssence.github.io

This site is primarily an asset cloud, where I put slides and other resources for quick access and posterity.

See live version under https://cssence.github.io/.

## Setup

To be used as is, zero dependencies, no build script.

The `/docs` folder is source and hosted version at the same time. Ideally, point an [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) of your choice there.
